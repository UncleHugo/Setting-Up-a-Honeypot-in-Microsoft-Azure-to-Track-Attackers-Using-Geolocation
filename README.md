# Setting-Up-a-Honeypot-in-Microsoft-Azure-to-Track-Attackers-Using-Geolocation

Ever wondered where cyber attackers are coming from? I set up a honeypot VM on Microsoft Azure, exposed it to attacks, and tracked the attackers using geolocation data.

In this lab, we will

- Deploy an Azure Virtual Machine as a honeypot
- Allow all inbound traffic to attract attackers
- Configure Log Analytics Workspace
- Set up Microsoft Sentinel to collect logs
- Querying failed login attempts 
- Extract failed RDP login attempts and attacker IPs
- Use a PowerShell script to get geolocation data
- Visualize attacker locations on a world map


## Step 1: Deploy the Honeypot Virtual Machine

To simulate a vulnerable system, I created an Azure Virtual Machine and i turned off the VM Firewall from the OS Level so as to enable attack access to the VM.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure.
My machine 
‚Ä¢Name: UAT-server
‚Ä¢Resource Group: hugo-rg
‚Ä¢Specs: Standard B4as v2 (4 vcpus, 16 GiB memory)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Network Security Group (NSG):
‚Ä¢Go to Networking ‚Üí Select Advanced ‚Üí Create new NSG.
‚Ä¢Delete default inbound rules and create a new rule:
‚Ä¢Port: * (Allow all)
‚Ä¢Protocol: Any
‚Ä¢Action: Allow
‚Ä¢Priority: 200
‚Ä¢Rule Name: AllowAnyCustomAnyInbound

### Set Up Log Collection with Microsoft Sentinel

Now, we need to monitor incoming attacks using Microsoft Sentinel.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Log Analytics Workspace (UAT-LogWorkSpace) to store and query logs.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Microsoft Sentinel and link it to the workspace.

Installing the ‚ÄúWindows Security Events via AMA‚Äù Data Connector:
‚Ä¢Go to Data Connectors ‚Üí Select Windows Security Events via AMA.
‚Ä¢Click Create New Data Collection Rule.
‚Ä¢Name: Windows Events, select the VM, and Connect.

üìå This allows Sentinel to collect login attempt data from the honeypot!
